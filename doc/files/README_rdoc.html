      <h1>ContactKit</h1>
<h6>======</h6>
<p>
ContactKit is a collection of all of the associations I find useful when
creating a simple (or complicated) application as I always seem to end up
using these same associations. In each of these classes you will find
little goodies that allow you to work effectively with the association
type. All are equipped with polymorphic attributes so you can use them any
want in multiple classes without interference.
</p>
<p>
I added in a sample Order class that shows how one could usefully connect
these as associations using the belongs to method. In a real order class
you would most likely never use a belongs_to association as address
normalization in not what you want. In that case you would use a has_one
association as you need to record the data in that record for the given
order.
</p>
<p>
Below is that a class using the belongs_to example:
</p>
<pre>
  class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :email

    belongs_to :phone_number
    belongs_to :ip_address

    belongs_to :shipping_address,       :class_name =&gt; 'Address'
    belongs_to :billing_address,        :class_name =&gt; 'Address'

    belongs_to :shipping_receipient, :class_name =&gt; 'Person'
    belongs_to :billing_receipient, :class_name =&gt; 'Person'

  end
</pre>
<p>
Perhaps the most useful part of ContactKit is the Address class as it makes
use of Geokit to verify the address location. It doesn this by making a
call to google geocode (or yahoo depending on configuration). Although your
limited to what yahoo or google have listed in their database, I think you
will find that they have a pretty accurate reading on worldwide addresses.
</p>
<pre>
 I wrote this class to get around using expensive services such as QuickAddress and Melissa Data (which are excellent options if you have the money eg, ~$20K US a year).  You will have to install the geokit-rails  plugin and the geokit gem to make use of all these nifty features. I also
</pre>
<p>
went a little bit further to normalise the Address attributes such as City,
Region and Country which are saved and stored in their respective tables.
</p>
<p>
Oh one other nice thing the Address class does is make use of
GeoKit&#8216;s geoip and geocodes the address on the save.
</p>

<p>
If you do use this, please send me a note and tell me if it was useful!
</p>
<p>
Sample Address Usage (in console):
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; address = Address.new(:street_address =&gt; '1 icon', :postal_code =&gt;'92610')

  =&gt; #&lt;Address id: nil, street_address: &quot;1 icon&quot;, postal_code: &quot;92610&quot;, city_id: nil, md5: nil, lat: nil, lng: nil, addressable_id: nil, addressable_type: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;

  &gt;&gt; address.valid?
  =&gt; true

  &gt;&gt; address
  =&gt; #&lt;Address id: nil, street_address: &quot;1 ICON&quot;, postal_code: &quot;92610&quot;, city_id: 7, md5: nil, lat: #&lt;BigDecimal:b71c6bac,'0.3367182E2',12(12)&gt;, lng: #&lt;BigDecimal:b71c6b5c,'-0.117645876E3',12(16)&gt;, addressable_id: nil, addressable_type: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt;
</pre>
<h1>Manual Setup</h1>
<p>
Copy the models and data (or at least the ones you want in your app) into
your db/ folder. cp -r vendor/plugins/contact_magic/db/migrate
RAILS_ROOT/db/migrate
</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>
These collection of models are also useful as a polymorphic association.
For example, if you had a Company class that also had and address you could
easily just do add in a contact and address along side the order model by
doing something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :contact, :as =&gt; :personable
    has_one :billing_address, :as =&gt; :addressable

    # or mix them up
    belongs_to :email # must have a email_id in the table.
    has_many :ip_addresses, :as =&gt; :ipable

    has_one :phone_number, :as =&gt; :phonable
  end
</pre>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<pre>
  A MySQL database
    Unfortunately, this won't work with sqlite3 as I am loading in the
    countries in the migration as well as making making use of the Geokit
    plugin's acts_as_mappable. This prooves to be very handy when searching
    for locations using Geokit's geocode-rich search features.

  geokit gem and geokit-rails plugin:

    Dig (DNS lookup utility)

      Dig is used to make sure an email address acutally has a server.

        Ubuntu
        sudo apt-get install dnsutils

        OsX
        http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dig.1.html
        I believe it is on OsX's default installation.
